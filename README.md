# An Ethereum txpool watcher

The code utilizes the RPC directory under Ethereum as a dependency to interact with the Ethereum blockchain via a Remote Procedure Call (RPC). 

The RPC module provides the tools and protocols to call functions, execute commands, and interact with an Ethereum node programmatically. This enables the application to query the Ethereum blockchain for information, submit transactions, and retrieve data about the transaction pool directly from a node, leveraging the functions defined in the go-ethereum/rpc package.
